We did grow in Greater China by 4% during the quarter versus the previous quarter, it was driven by an acceleration by iPhone, although we also had substantial growth on the Mac year over year. As you know, the government has placed certain subsidies that affects some of our products, not all of them, but there are some of them. And I think that had some effect. It was the first full quarter of the subsidy playing out that cut in during a portion of the previous quarter.
The other things I would say are that the installed base hit a record high in Greater China and we set an all-time record for the iPhone installed base. The iPhone upgraders in Mainland China set a record for the June quarter.
And according to Worldpanel, which was formerly known as Kantar, iPhone had the top three models in Urban China, which is extraordinary.

In terms of the tariff situation in country of origin and so forth, one thing I would say, just to remind everyone is keep in mind that the vast majority of our products are covered under the Section 232 investigation. And so today or I should say, last quarter, the bulk of the tariffs that we paid were the EEPA tariffs that hit early in the year related to China. And so that's just a reminder of where things are and what we assumed as we calculated the projection of $1.1 billion that's in our outlook color.
In terms of the country of origin, it's the same as I referenced last quarter. There hasn't been a change to that, which is the vast majority of the iPhones sold in the US or the majority, I should say, have a country of origin of India and the vast majority of the products, other products, the Mac, and the iPad, and the watch have a country of origin of Vietnam that are sold in the United States. Still, the products for other international countries, the vast majority of them are coming from China. And so that hopefully gives you a flavor of where things are.
But I would stress again that we do a lot in this country in the United States. And we've committed $500 billion, and we're always looking to do more. And you could kind of see that in the most recent announcements, whether it's MP Materials or our manufacturing academy that we're standing up in Detroit in a couple of weeks or so.
And so we're going to be doing -- we're doing more in this country, and that's on top of having roughly 19 billion chips coming out of the US now, and we will do more, and of course, glass from iPhone in the face ID module.

When I take the $1.1 billion that you're now sort of expecting for the September quarter and as we start to think about December, is there anything unique in the December quarter in terms of sourcing from regions, et cetera, that would uniquely impact December, just given sort of that you had highlighted that quarter to quarter, so there would be unique things.
